# Classify-Waste-Products-Using-Transfer-Learning

## Project Overview
EcoClean currently lacks an efficient and scalable method to automate the waste sorting process. The manual sorting of waste is not only labor-intensive but also prone to errors, leading to contamination of recyclable materials. The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and computer vision to automate the classification of waste products, improving efficiency and reducing contamination rates. The project will use transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images.

## Aim of the Project
The aim of the project is to develop an automated waste classification model that can accurately differentiate between recyclable and organic waste based on images. By the end of this project, you will have trained, fine-tuned, and evaluated a model using transfer learning, which can then be applied to real-world waste management processes.

Final Output: A trained model that classifies waste images into recyclable and organic categories.

## Learning Objectives
After you complete the project, you will be able to:

- Apply transfer learning using the VGG16 model for image classification.
- Prepare and preprocess image data for a machine learning task.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model to improve classification accuracy.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics.
- Visualize model predictions on test data.
